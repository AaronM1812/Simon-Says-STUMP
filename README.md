# Simon Says 🎵🟥🟩🟨🟦

Simon Says is a memory game written entirely in low-level **STUMP** assembly, running on a custom STUMP processor and peripheral board.

The game presents an ever-growing sequence of coloured quadrants (red, green, yellow, blue), each paired with a unique audio tone. The player must accurately reproduce the sequence using the keypad. With every successful round, the sequence length increases, placing greater demands on memory, timing, and precision.

> This repository contains my **COMP22111 – Microprocessor Systems (Exercise 3)** submission and demonstrates low-level embedded programming, memory-mapped I/O, and state-machine-driven game logic.

## How the Game Works

- The game operates as a **finite-state machine** implemented directly in STUMP assembly.
- **Visual feedback** is provided via the LED matrix and LCD.
- **User input** is captured from the keypad with explicit debouncing.
- **Audio and haptic feedback** reinforce correct and incorrect interactions.
- Game difficulty scales by increasing the sequence length each round.

---

## Controls

All interaction uses the keypad:

- `1` – Red quadrant
- `3` – Green quadrant
- `9` – Yellow quadrant
- `7` – Blue quadrant
- `Any key` – Start / input

## Project Structure

This repository follows the structure provided for the exercise:

- **`Exercise3/SimonSays.s`**
  Main STUMP assembly source file containing all game logic, state transitions, I/O handling, and animations.

---

## Main Game Logic

The core loop follows a numbered execution cycle documented in the internal comments and labels in `SimonSays.s`.

Stage Overview
The game loop is split into numbered stages, matching the comments in SimonSays.s.

[0] RESET / INIT SYSTEM
Clears the LED matrix and resets all peripheral states.

Resets core game variables:

Level counter

Sequence index

Input tracking buffers

Jumps into attract mode.

[1] INIT DISPLAY
Displays “SIMON SAYS – PRESS ANY KEY TO START” on the LCD.

Cycles through coloured quadrants as an attract animation.

Waits for a clean key press and release before starting.

[2] DISPLAYING SEQUENCE
Plays back the current colour sequence:

Each colour lights a quadrant on the LED matrix.

A matching tone is played via the buzzer.

The sequence is stored in memory and replayed deterministically.

After playback completes, control moves to user input.

[3] ASSESSING USER INPUT
Polls the keypad with explicit debouncing logic.

Decodes key presses into colour selections.

For each key press:

Lights the corresponding quadrant.

Plays the associated tone.

Input is compared incrementally against the stored sequence.

[4] INPUT FEEDBACK
Provides immediate visual and audio feedback for each input.

Correct inputs advance the input index.

Incorrect inputs branch immediately to failure handling.

[5] VERIFY
Checks whether the full sequence has been entered correctly.

If complete and correct:

Advances the level counter.

Extends the sequence.

Returns to DISPLAYING SEQUENCE.

[6] CHECK FOR WIN / FAIL
Win condition:

Final level reached.

Green flashing animation.

Victory sound.

LCD displays “YOU WIN!!”.

Fail condition:

Incorrect input detected.

Red flashing animation.

Buzzer and vibration motor feedback.

LCD displays “GAME OVER!!”.

Game returns to attract mode after reset.

Implementation Highlights
Pure STUMP assembly — no high-level language abstractions.

Extensive use of memory-mapped I/O:

LED matrix, LCD display, Keypad, Buzzer, Vibration motor.

Structured state-machine control flow.

Table-driven routines for:

Colour → output mapping

Tone generation

Delay timing

Modular subroutines for input polling, sequence playback, and animations.

Clear separation between game state, user input handling, and output rendering.

Future Improvements
Randomised sequence generation using a hardware counter.

Difficulty scaling via timing reduction.

Score or highest-level persistence.

Enhanced audio patterns.

Multi-round endurance mode.
