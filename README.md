# Simon Says 🎵🟥🟩🟨🟦

Simon Says is a memory game written entirely in low-level *STUMP* assembly, running on a custom STUMP processor and peripheral board.

The game presents an ever-growing sequence of coloured quadrants (red, green, yellow, blue), each paired with a unique audio tone. The player must accurately reproduce the sequence using the keypad. With every successful round, the sequence length increases, placing greater demands on memory, timing, and precision.

This repository contains my *COMP22111 – Microprocessor Systems (Exercise 3)* submission and demonstrates low-level embedded programming, memory-mapped I/O, and state-machine-driven game logic.

## How the Game Works

•⁠  ⁠The game operates as a *finite-state machine* implemented directly in STUMP assembly.  
•⁠  ⁠Visual feedback is provided via the LED matrix and LCD.  
•⁠  ⁠User input is captured from the keypad with explicit *debouncing*.  
•⁠  ⁠Audio and haptic feedback reinforce correct and incorrect interactions.  
•⁠  ⁠Game difficulty scales by increasing the sequence length each round.

---

## Controls

All interaction uses the keypad:

•⁠  ⁠⁠ 1 ⁠ – Red quadrant  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ 3 ⁠ – Green quadrant  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ 9 ⁠ – Yellow quadrant  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ 7 ⁠ – Blue quadrant  
•⁠  ⁠Any key – Start / input

## Project Structure

This repository follows the structure provided for the exercise:

•⁠  ⁠*⁠ Exercise3/SimonSays.s ⁠*  
  Main STUMP assembly source file containing all game logic, state transitions, I/O handling, and animations.

## Main Game Logic

The core loop follows a numbered execution cycle documented in the internal comments and labels in *SimonSays.s*.

The game loop is split into numbered stages, matching the comments in SimonSays.s.

Stage Overview
[0] RESET / INIT SYSTEM
•⁠ ⁠Clears the LED matrix and resets all peripheral states.
•⁠ ⁠Resets game variables including:

Level counter

Sequence index

Input tracking buffers
•⁠ ⁠Jumps into attract mode.

[1] INIT DISPLAY
•⁠ ⁠Displays “SIMON SAYS – PRESS ANY KEY TO START” on the LCD.
•⁠ ⁠Cycles through coloured quadrants as an attract animation.
•⁠ ⁠Waits for a clean key press and release before starting.

[2] DISPLAYING SEQUENCE
•⁠ ⁠Plays back the current colour sequence:

Each colour lights a quadrant on the LED matrix.

A matching tone is played via the buzzer.
•⁠ ⁠The sequence is stored in memory and replayed deterministically.
•⁠ ⁠After playback completes, control moves to user input.

[3] ASSESSING USER INPUT
•⁠ ⁠Polls the keypad with explicit debouncing logic.
•⁠ ⁠Decodes key presses into colour selections.
•⁠ ⁠Each press:

Lights the corresponding quadrant

Plays the associated tone
•⁠ ⁠Input is compared incrementally against the stored sequence.

[4] INPUT FEEDBACK
•⁠ ⁠Provides immediate visual and audio feedback for each input.
•⁠ ⁠Correct inputs advance the input index.
•⁠ ⁠Incorrect inputs branch immediately to failure handling.

[5] VERIFY
•⁠ ⁠Checks whether the full sequence has been entered correctly.
•⁠ ⁠If complete and correct:

Advances the level counter

Extends the sequence

Returns to DISPLAYING SEQUENCE

[6] CHECK FOR WIN / FAIL
Win condition
•⁠ ⁠Final level reached
•⁠ ⁠Green flashing animation
•⁠ ⁠Victory sound
•⁠ ⁠LCD displays “YOU WIN!!”

Fail condition
•⁠ ⁠Incorrect input detected
•⁠ ⁠Red flashing animation
•⁠ ⁠Buzzer + vibration motor feedback
•⁠ ⁠LCD displays “GAME OVER!!”
•⁠ ⁠Game returns to attract mode after reset.

Implementation Highlights
•⁠ ⁠Pure STUMP assembly — no high-level language abstractions
•⁠ ⁠Extensive use of memory-mapped I/O:

LED matrix

LCD display

Keypad

Buzzer

Vibration motor
•⁠ ⁠Structured state-machine control flow
•⁠ ⁠Table-driven routines for:

Colour → output mapping

Tone generation

Delay timing
•⁠ ⁠Modular subroutines for:

Input polling and debouncing

Sequence playback

Win / fail animations
•⁠ ⁠Clear separation between:

Game state

User input handling

Output rendering

Future Improvements
•⁠ ⁠Randomised sequence generation using a hardware counter
•⁠ ⁠Difficulty scaling via timing reduction
•⁠ ⁠Score or highest-level persistence
•⁠ ⁠Enhanced audio patterns
•⁠ ⁠Multi-round endurance mode
